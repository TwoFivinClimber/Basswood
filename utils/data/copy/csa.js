  whatIs1: 'CSA, short for Community Supported Agriculture, is a mutually beneficial arrangement that fosters a deeper connection between local farmers and the members of their community. This partnership goes beyond the simple transaction of purchasing produce; it embodies a shared commitment to sustainable agriculture, food security, and environmental stewardship.',
  whatIs2: 'Our CSA is a budding passion project. We plant, tend to, and harvest crops with the understanding that community members, or "shareholders," will invest in the farm by purchasing shares before the growing season begins. In return, these shareholders receive a regular supply of organically grown seasonal vegetables on a weekly basis.',
  ourCsa: "Here at Woodhouse Homestead, we've recently embarked on an exciting journey by introducing our very own CSA program, despite our history of tending to these fields since 1980. It's a significant step for us, and it underscores our commitment to evolving with the changing landscape of agriculture while staying rooted in our farming heritage.  Our program offers weekely or bi-weekly produce pickups with the optional addition of astenesial products in a pay as you go model.  While we are getting the program up to speed, spots on the list are based on availibility and consistency of program support.",
